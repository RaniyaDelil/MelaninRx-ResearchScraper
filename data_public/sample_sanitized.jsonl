With my first, I labored for a full 24 hours, 8 of them at cm with rolling thunder contractions. No sleep for two full days and nights, no food. Baby tried to come before I was ready, got stuck. C-section. I watched in the exhausted haze as they took out my uterus and plopped it on my chest and took out my baby all in the reflection of the light above me. The nurses behind me were too busy talking about their plans for the weekend to hear me mention I was going to puke. And puke I did, all over my hair. A humiliated mess, they sewed me back up and without cleaning me up put me in the room next to the nurses station for the night (apparently I was bleeding a lot and needed to be monitored more closely. They kept me up all night giggling and talking really loudly. The pain felt unmanageable, especially once I finally got home. I was hysterical.\n\nAnyways, here we are 32 weeks with #2, measuring at 37 weeks. No gestational diabetes, no other medical condition to explain why baby is so big. He's just huge. C-section is inevitable, he's already nearly 6lbs. I have people constantly invalidating what I've been through and what pain I expect to suffer. Saying stuff like \"how can you take x pain medication (that's prescribed) while breastfeeding!? That's irresponsible! You should go unmedicated for your baby.\" Or \" your fiance shouldn't take off more than 1 week of work to help you.\" I'm so incredibly fortunate to have a fiance who sees me. Saw everything my body did and had to go through. Helping me pull up my diapers and being patient with me every step of the way.\n\nHe wants me to be done working because I'm on my feet all day and I'm not just uncomfortable, I'm in pain. My pelvis hurts so bad. I'm starting to become incontinent. I'm fine, really I guess...and we need the money bad. I just get so much shit from EVERYONE when I mention being done soon. Even my doctor wants me to keep working. I exercise (lots of walks) regularly so I'm not like lazy. I don't know. I get I need to do what's best for me and my family, but I need everyone to shut up and be supportive and validate my needs. I dont want baby to come early but I'm out of energy. Working part time while raising my toddler, no daycare. I want my energy back. I want my body back and I know I'm far from both. Wish me luck these next 7 weeks. SEVEN WEEKS. Or, you know.. emergency c-section instead of a planned one. \n\nEdit: I think too many of you are focused on the title rather than my actual issues. Didn't say people shouldn't have them. I just want them to be recognized as a major surgery. People love to hate though, welcome to the internet. Thank you for all the kind supportive comments. ","score":658,"num_comments":245}

Leaving the house without doing this will bring you a world of regret (especially since public restrooms aren‚Äôt a thing right now.)\n\n2. Your nipples will leak without telling you and then they will dry, and you‚Äôll look down the next morning and immediately think you have cancer or a rare nipple disease oh my god. \n\n3. Speaking of nipples, they are permanently erect now and they feel like fire at all times. You can cut glass with them. You are now Andy Bernard in that episode of The Office with the rabies fun-run. \n\n4. Your baby can, and WILL, kick you square in the butthole from inside the womb. They do not apologize. Do not expect flowers. \n\n5. First kicks don‚Äôt always feel like butterflies or a fun little goldfish. They can also feel like your bladder is trying to off itself one explosion at a time. It will launch you off the couch in a panic and there is nothing you can do about it. \n\n6. You won‚Äôt know where your stomach is anymore now that your organs are all squished around. Your doctor doesn‚Äôt know. Your midwife doesn‚Äôt know. Nobody fucking knows but you‚Äôll still get reminded that it‚Äôs there by the HOT LAVA heartburn that happens if you even THINK about a banana before going to sleep. \n\n7. Doing the dishes takes three sessions because standing up is impossible for more than two minutes. You will feel like you need an oxygen tank. Or a priest. \n\n8. Constipation is more difficult than normal because, as you may remember from #6, you don‚Äôt know or understand where your organs are anymore. Your body is just trying to poop but your liver and kidneys suddenly have to voice their shitty opinions, as well as whatever the hell is in your ribcage at the moment, and you more than likely will google ‚ÄúAM I DYING?‚Äù at four AM. This will happen more than once. \n\nHave I missed anything? I‚Äôm only 25 weeks so I guess I get another full trimester to find out.

I really do appreciate boundaries and clarity, but this wasn‚Äôt warm or welcoming - it was a cold, corporate-style manual. It was LONG. I felt like I had just studied for an exam after reading it. Absolutely no stone was left unturned- There were multiple lengthy attachments covering everything from ‚Äúhelping before baby‚Äù to ‚Äúrules for visiting postpartum.‚Äù With all the documents included plus the email itself it had to have been at LEAST 40-50 pages. I‚Äôm just doing my best to convey the highlights. \n\nIt started out reasonable with expected boundaries: no kissing the baby, wash your hands, don‚Äôt visit if you‚Äôre sick. Totally fine. But then it went way beyond:\n\t‚Ä¢\tAdvice clause: ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôve not asked for advice, keep your comments to yourself.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\tBaby prep help: A sign-up sheet with tasks that were mostly just home renovation projects - landscaping, rebuilding parts of the yard, even electrical work. The list was LONG. My partner and I were cracking up- especially because these people are loaded. Get professionals to help! \n\t‚Ä¢\tMeal prep binder: A 20+ page document with strict dietary rules, photos from cookbooks, specific recipes, and detailed instructions for how to act in their kitchen.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNotifications spreadsheet: If you wanted to be told when the baby arrived, you had to sign up and agree to a list of what would/wouldn‚Äôt be disclosed and what you could/couldn‚Äôt ask.\n\t‚Ä¢\tMeeting baby: Required booking through a professional scheduling link. Personally, I wanted some flexibility postpartum, but hey. \n\t‚Ä¢\tOvernight visits: A separate link with rules about how to ‚Äúbook this‚Äù, instructions for remaking the bed when you leave, and an agreement that overnight guests must bottle-feed but can‚Äôt change diapers (you must wake up parents for this throughout the night since no one but parents are allowed to do so).\n\t‚Ä¢\tChores: excessive instructions for laundry (exact pumps of detergent, scoop measurements, machine settings), dishes, errands, pet care, etc. Plus: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask us to get up. Don‚Äôt ask us to show you anything. Don‚Äôt use our dishes, bring your own water bottle.‚Äù LOL. They even included their Peet‚Äôs coffee orders.\n\nSome highlights that stuck with me:\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúClear the room and find something else to do if mom is breastfeeding.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt raise conflict with us about anything until at least 6 months postpartum.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúAsk for consent before bringing gifts - no toys, no stuffed animals. We are not accepting gifts at this time.‚Äù \n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get offended if we ask you not to hold the baby. Only people we deem to be in good vision/ overall health are allowed to hold the baby.‚Äù \n\nI had been planning to drop by for a visit, but after reading this, I no longer feel comfortable. My partner joked we should just bring our own toilet paper and use the bathroom in the yard to avoid breaking a rule.\n\nMy takeaways:\n\t1.\tThe people who actually overstep boundaries and need micromanaging probably won‚Äôt read 4+ attachments/ links anyway.\n\t2.\tEveryone else who‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù just ends up feeling put off. I‚Äôve heard from multiple people  that this email was super off-putting. \n\t3.\tWith this many rigid expectations, resentment feels inevitable.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I respect boundaries - I think they‚Äôre healthy. But this wasn‚Äôt just boundaries; it was micromanagement in the form of a policy manual. And it made people feel more like employees than loved ones.","score":480,"num_comments":194}

Fetal macrosomia, especially at extremes (most providers say 11lbs and above) can increase risk of severe complications like shoulder dystocia. When babies reach a certain estimated size, the risk of these severe complications greatly increases. Is a risk a guarantee that it‚Äôll happen? No, but as with anything, each individual needs to do their own risk assessment and decide how much risk they are willing to accept. However, childbirth is still a leading global cause of death in women, particularly in low resourced areas that do not have access to appropriate medical interventions. Managing risk is essential to a safe delivery.\n\n\nIf you really want a vaginal birth and know you might end up with an emergency c-section, that‚Äôs fine! But listen to your medical providers about the risks and options. Their job is to literally KEEP YOU AND BABY SAFE AND ALIVE. They are not recommending an induction or c-section because they have plans, they are recommending it because they believe the outcome will be better for you and your LO.

Emergency C sections seem to have the worst outcomes, while scheduled ones can provide a sense of control and comfort.\n\nAnd it also seems like people have different experiences with c sections and having their arms tied down, not experiencing golden hour, etc. Those are NOT universal and plenty of women have said they weren‚Äôt tied down and were given their baby right away, etc.\n\nI completely understand the women for whom birth is a magical empowering experience, but I just don‚Äôt personally see it that way.

My OBYN said that everything was going well and assured me I should have a smooth delivery. I was huge but otherwise feeling great.\n\n Then it happened. I was walking down the stairs after my appointment, missed about 2 steps and fell hard and awkwardly onto my leg. I was laying at the bottom of the stairs in excruciating pain and knew instantly that I had broken my ankle/leg. I tried to crawl and get up but couldn't. I can't describe it but I was both panicked and calm at the same time. I tried several more times to get up but couldn't move. I pulled my phone out and called my OBGYN's office. \"Hi, this is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I just had an appointment with Dr. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and I just fell down the stairs and I think I broke my leg.\" The receptionist stayed on the phone with me until my OBGYN and several other doctors and nurses got to me. She kept asking me questions and I told her I was going to get sick and my stomach was cramping really bad.\n\nMy OBGYN and several other doctors and nurses rushed to me with a wheelchair. They quickly realized that they weren't going to be able to get me into the wheelchair. I was going into shock and honestly didn't realize that I was going into labor until I overheard my OBGYN order one of the nurses to get me a stretcher and get more help because I was going into labor. Everyone tried to keep me calm and comfortable, but the contractions were coming very quick. I threw up at one point. There was also no way I was going to be able to get transferred to the stretcher and into a room either. I suddenly realized that I was going to give birth right there. \n\n  \nThey blocked off the stairwell. Needless to say, I was in excruciating pain. Someone propped up my ankle on some pillows and stabilized it in an aircast boot while my OBGYN ordered someone to call my husband. They told him to get here ASAP. I got some heavy duty pain meds in an IV and my vitals were being monitored. Within an hour and a half, my husband made it and our baby girl was born. What a whirlwind. That was an experience that I will never forget, but I am so happy to have a healthy baby. Baby and I are still in the hospital. I need to follow up with an orthopedist on Monday to see if my broken ankle will just require a cast or if I will also need surgery.\n\n It's going to be an interesting 6-10 weeks being on crutches and taking care of a newborn, to say the least.

The chances of you getting any type of illness is so small that it‚Äôs not worth stressing over. Drink the caffeine. Do what you want.

Just wanted to vent.\n\nLast Thursday (08/14/25), I went in for a routine follow up appt. Which was also my 20week appointment. I was extremely excited since I get to see my son and his full anatomy. He was healthy! My cervix was checked as well as part of the 20week appointment and everything went downhill from there. They found out that my cervix was open. I did not feel any pain or any signs of labor.\n\nAfter my ultrasound, my doctor shared her concerns. Upon the initial ultrasound she said it can go two ways. 1) She keeps me pregnant and everything is fine. 2) The baby has to be delivered and that is the end of the pregnancy.\n\nI was rushed to L&D immediately. Upon further exams, there was no saving the pregnancy. I was dilating, membranes can be seen, and I had an infection. They drew blood to test C Reactive Protein and it came back 6x higher than normal. My doctor couldn‚Äôt determine whether the infection caused IC or if the IC caused the infection. Either way, my doctor said her job at that point was to save my life. Which was extremely heart breaking.\n\nAnyway, I had my son on 8/15/25 at 7:05a and died peacefully in my arms at 8:45a. Prior to delivering at 5:50a I asked my nurse if I can hear his heartbeat before I birth him. He had a heartbeat and hearing it for the last time broke my heart into a million pieces. We decided to name him Willow.ü•∫üíô\n\nThis is the worst feeling ever! This is also my first pregnancy.\n\nHow did you cope with the loss? How long until you tried again?\n\n\nEdit: Wow.
