The father is a guy I‚Äôm friends with benefits but nowhere near close to being in a relationship with, he‚Äôs also not aware that I‚Äôm pregnant, and I‚Äôm not interested in one with him at the moment. I work night shifts. I‚Äôm planning on going back to school to pursue nursing. I still haven‚Äôt moved out or gotten my drivers license.\n\nIt‚Äôs just not the right time. This is a recipe for disaster, the exact thing everyone warns young women about. I‚Äôm nowhere near prepared for a baby. It was so unexpected. My mum was around my age when she had me in similar circumstances. She has been very open about her life being filled with stress and depression ever since due to the weight of being a single mother in poverty with multiple kids. I don‚Äôt want that for myself.\n\nBut a part of me is sad. I‚Äôve always wanted a child and I know I‚Äôll be able to have one in the future. I‚Äôve also always been very pro choice. A part of me still wishes the timing could‚Äôve been better, or that I could‚Äôve been more prepared. I had a steady income or a better support system. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm so attached to something that hasn‚Äôt even got a body yet. But no one will win if I have a baby so unprepared. Not my future child, not the father and not me either.

My soon to be MIL has tried telling my fiance and I that we shouldn't let all that's going on deter us and put our lives on hold, but I take this opinion with a grain of salt considering she really wants more grandbabies and is an older white woman who doesn't seem to fully understand the dangers associated with black maternal healthcare in this country.

I just want advice from other black women who may have experienced the same. \n\nBefore you say anything, I know. I am stupid. How could I let this happen again?! My life plan has always been to get married first and then have my babies. I‚Äôve always wanted to have babies, ever since I was a little girl. I was the little girl that said I would NEVER have an abortion. \n\nI‚Äòve lived a very sheltered life and was mostly homeschooled due to bullying. This brought on insecurities and I didn‚Äôt start dating/putting myself out there until I was 24 and experienced ‚Äúa glow up‚Äù. The first guy to ever ask me out, I gave my all to. He was my first kiss and, to this day, my first and only sexual partner. He has 2 kids from a previous relationship, which I didn‚Äôt judge him for. I lost my virginity and found out I was pregnant shortly after. It all happened so fast and I decided I was not ready yet and had an abortion. The guy and I were more compatible as friends, but I could never seem to truly end things with him. I did NOT set healthy boundaries for myself. 80% of the times we had sex was because he would wake me up at 4am, pulling my underwear off and I didn‚Äôt say no. When I think back to how much shit I went through, it was sooo unnecessary. \n\nIn December of 2023, (now 28) I got pregnant again by him which was a huge wake up call. He was verbally abusive towards me and I just KNEW that I couldn‚Äôt have a baby with him. Sadly, I went through with a 2nd abortion and the depression that followed. I cut my ex off and was DONE. I somehow came out shining and started dressing up more and getting a LOT of looks from new guys. I fell hard for this new guy, but after telling him I wanted to wait to have sex, he suddenly stopped talking to me for weeks. This broke me, and of course my ex reappeared at this time. He needed a place to stay for the night and we had a long, forgiving talk. I made it clear that I want no romantic relationship with him and he understood. We smoked and fell asleep, and yet again, I was woken up at 4am to him kissing on me and pulling off my underwear. I remember thinking, ‚ÄúFuck it. It‚Äôs been months without sex, I‚Äôm young and nobody owns me and we have protection.‚Äù And had sex with him. It wasn‚Äôt even enjoyable, but I felt empowered. Oddly enough, the guy I was talking to messaged me and apologized and we reconnected. I forgave him but felt confident knowing I‚Äôm a free woman and can date who I please. Wrong. \n\nYesterday, I found out I‚Äôm pregnant. I really REALLY don‚Äôt want to have another abortion. I‚Äôm 28 now and I feel like it‚Äôs time. I want this baby. But i also know I do NOT want a baby with my ex. Im not married yet. At this point in my life, he‚Äôs not even someone I want to be friends with and I was so self-neglectful I‚Äôve made some horrible choices for myself. He‚Äôs not financially in a place to take care of the babe and he also has 2 other kids. I feel so ashamed and stupid right now, but mostly strong for this baby. I just didn‚Äôt want it to happen like this. What should I do? \n\nTLDR: pregnant by ex that I know I don‚Äôt want to co-parent with, but I really want this baby.

Please tell me if I‚Äôm wrong (vent)","text":"Looking for advice, someone please tell me if I‚Äôm wrong‚Ä¶\n\nMy sister is pregnant. I‚Äôm 26 and she‚Äôs 21 and while babies are a blessing, I‚Äôm not going to pretend that I‚Äôm happy about being an aunt.\n\nFor one, my sister is with a man who is the same age as me. They haven‚Äôt even been together a year. He has told her multiple times that he hates her, calls her out her name, is controlling, and is already a deadbeat dad to a eight year old and as you can guess, told my sister he‚Äôs not going to be there for her.\nMy sister complains about him to me and my family but claims she loves him and makes no effort to leave him, even after he tried to kick her door down. My sister had a miscarriage in February and I told her that she really needs to use protection. I‚Äôve told her this multiple times and told her that STDs are still very much a thing and she barely knows this guy but she always claimed that it‚Äôs fine because she was on birth control.\nThat aside, my sister lives in a tiny apartment with no furniture. Barely any cooking utensils and an air mattress. She has no stable job because she job hops and can barely afford to care for herself. She relies on me and my parents for help, even toiletries. And as much as I love her, she‚Äôs not mature enough. She‚Äôs still in her party phrase and has a lot of maturing to do. She said that my parents can help her and that she understands it‚Äôs her responsibility and she is mature because she‚Äôs 21 but she really isn‚Äôt. I know her and I know she‚Äôs not ready and me and my parents are basically gonna be the ones raising this child. She had a puppy that she ended up giving away because she couldn‚Äôt handle it even though I ended up raising it.\n\nThat‚Äôs really the core of why I‚Äôm so upset, if she was working/going to school and with someone who loved and cared about her I‚Äôd be upset but I‚Äôd be supportive because Ik mistakes happen. But because she‚Äôs doing nothing with her life and having unportective sex after I stressed to her how important it is and especially with a guy who said he hates her and is already a deadbeat, it just reinforced that my sister is still immature. After I told her how I felt about her decision I guess she told my mom and my mom told me I need to put my feelings aside and support my sisters because she wished she had a supportive sister when she got pregnant (she had me at 17 my dad 19). My mom even had the nerve to say that I don‚Äôt always listen to advice my parents give me and I‚Äôm not perfect but I never said I was and me not listening has never led to me bringing a child into this world when I know I can‚Äôt support it.\n\nBecause of all of this and because I know how this will end up, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm exactly supportive about the circumstances of me becoming an aunt. I know it‚Äôs no longer about me or my feelings, but my future niece or nephew. I know it‚Äôs my sisters life but I still find myself feeling disappointed that she‚Äôs accepting the bare minimum in her life like this. Please tell me, am I being selfish for feeling this way?","score":113,"num_comments":45,"likely_black_context":true,"matched_preg_terms":["miscarriage","pregnant"],"matched_black_terms":[]}

A fee other fibroids were also detected but this one, due to its location, was deduced to be the cause of 2 years of excruciating pain and heavy hemorrhaging. I didn't wait 2 years to seek help, but it did take 2 years to find a doctor who would listen and investigate my symptoms as opposed to dismissing me with BC prescriptions. \n \nLuckily I qualified for a hysteroscopic myomectomy since my fibroids were small. I had surgery in December of 2023. My doctor advised that I consider planning for pregnancy after recovery due to my advanced age (36) and high likelihood that the fibroid would return in a year or two. My cramps did improve, and the bleeding was less heavy, but I still felt off. \n\n3 months later we became pregnant but lost the pregnancy around 7 weeks. Traumatized, I refused to try again without more insights about my health. The medical doctors said that I could get extra fertility testing if we didnt get pregnant afte.a year or had 2 more miscarriages. \n \nI pivoted to a Natropathic doctor who specializes in hormonal health. She ran a comprehensive blood panel and discovered that I had severely low progesterone. She determine that without hormone supplements I may have recurrent miscarriages. In addition to progesterone she prescribed DIM and other estrogen balancing supplements. \n\nThree months later, we successfully conceived on our first try. I continued the progesterone through 15 weeks of pregnancy. \n\nI live in a predominantly white and affluent part of San Diego where the local hospitals do not have black OBGYNS. Luckily I found a phenomenal birthcenter with a black midwife and black midwife apprentice who managed my care. They provoded the most empowering and nuturing medical care ever. My pregnancy was smooth and low risk. I worked until 39 weeks\n\n\nAt 41 weeks and 4 days I went into labor at 3am. Thanks to the support of our birth team, which now included our black doula, our son arrived 13 hours layer via unmedicated labor. He was 8lbs and 21 inches of perfection. I had no tears or complications. Every desire in our birth plan was met and exceeded.\n\nMy son and I are thriving under their care. I've had postpartum care the the comfort \nOf my home. They're also the baby's care provider  for the first 6 weeks of his life. My midwife encapsulated my placenta and has been on-call 24-7 for any questions or needs. \n\nBlackmidwives save lives! Their care was extremely comprehensive. I had ultrasounds, genetic testing, blood panels and vital screenings throughout my pregnancy. At every visit I was served herbal teas and encouraged to rest comfortably on a queen bed during our hour long sessions were they provoded emotional support, lifestyle counseling, and extensive education. My husband, who is typically weary of anything medical, loved the visits too! They treated us like family.  \n\nI highly encourage other to seek midwifery care for their pregancies. You can see them in addition to or in place of your MD. At a minimum, work with a doula in your final trimester and during labor to advocate for you and provide support. \n\nOur doula is providing postpartum support when I return to work, which will help ease my mom guilt and anxiety over leaving my little one.","score":31,"num_comments":1,"likely_black_context":true,"matched_preg_terms":["doula","fertility","midwife","postpartum","pregnancy","pregnant","trimester"],"matched_black_terms":["black","black maternal"]}

To the ER I would go and they would run the same tests over and over again then pump me full of morphine and send me home. At some point I was afraid to go back to the dr because I felt like they assumed I was drug seeking.  It finally hit a head at 9 months when the pain was so bad I was projectile vomiting. I went to the ER and told the dr about my pain. She didn't even touch me. Immediately dismissed me as having sciatica, sent me home with tylenol and left the room.  I went home and cried all night, I even popped a vicodin and it didn't touch the pain.  I called the dr line and she yelled at me over the phone. I eventually went back to L&D where they made me wait overnight in pain for a doctor even though they had doctors on the floor.  I cried all night and all but one nurse was so rude to me.  My temperature was rising, my baby was in distress and I was starting to dilate. I rolled around in pain, a nurse came in and yelled at me for moving the band, she slammed my hand down to my side when I reached up to touch my belly.   Finally in the early am the doctor comes in saying it's appendicitis and they need to do a caesarian and appendectomy. I was terrified.  Turns out I had a rare condition called decidualized endometriosis.\n\nMy baby was ok. When I finally came to, the same doctor that dismissed me tried to come in and check on me.

I just wanted my baby. \n\nI believe my abuse came from me being in a relationship with an older white man.  What should have been a joyous birth is marred by the abuse at the hands of the ones that are supposed to heal and nurture.

","text":"After years of observation, I cannot express how much I appreciate Black American women, and this is just about the American girlies. I do love my African sisters but we need to do better when it comes to supporting the ladies in America. \n\n1. American BW are true social justice warriors both in person and online. I have seen the most hidden ethnic groups make very racist, ignorant and stereotypical statements on social media about black people but there is always that one or two BW that speak up, fight and defend us no matter what type of black person is being abused. \n\n2.  American BW have paved the way for all black people in western countries and have positively represented us in all forms of media, sports and arts. For example, BW directing their own movies, assisting the country with going to space, changing the medical field to bring attention to the death rates of women during pregnancy and promoted / started black owned businesses. \n\n3. American BW started the natural hair movement, black girl magic and melanin appreciation. I remember this one specifically because even here in Australia, they started selling darker foundations and featured dark skinned girls in their campaigns with their natural hair. (Yes, you are that influential) \n\n4. American BW bring unity wherever they go. I live in Australia and it took a Black American woman to start a sisters group that brought women from all over the country to network through events, promote their businesses and even assist women who need help finding housing and flatmates. \n\n5. American BW are extremely creative and cultured. Despite the history of lost identity for some, BW have managed to hold onto lots of African culture and have moulded it into a way that blends in with their culture, creating something timeless yet unique. Some examples: hair braiding, music, clothing, dance styles, slang, cooking etc. \n\nThese are just a few things I wanted to call out, there‚Äôs heaps more where that came from but I‚Äôm sure you all have better things to do. Please feel free to add more positive things about Black American Women that you know or appreciate. I‚Äôm so grateful for this reddit group and I hope all the women here have a lovely day, stay safe and always remember that black women (all of us) are the epitome of ethereal beauty, resilience, influence and femininity. üñ§","score":1124,"num_comments":152,"likely_black_context":true,"matched_preg_terms":["pregnancy"],"matched_black_terms":["african","black","black women"]}

Of course, most people talking the loudest are degreeless and particularly unqualified in the areas they choose to speak (health, biology, genetics etc). And no reading Dr. Sebi and Queen Afua doesn't count.\n\nAnd they don't include themselves when the studies finally show that AGING men aren't ideal.

Because the closer you get to 30, at least for me, there's been much more focus on fertility. My brother-in-law and his wife were subtly telling me over Thanksgiving to hurry up and find someone because they are having issues  (they are almost 10 years my senior and have been trying for  5 years).\n\nNow in my head, I say their story doesn't have to be mine. **My mom had me at 36 and my sister two years later, so that has always been a sense of comfort (I don't know if it is a false sense of hope). Also, I don't have endo or PCOS, and I've never used BC (that's another topic). I've met women from all over the world via university (nursing students), and they usually don't share the same stress regarding age and pregnancy.** \n\nPart of me wants to say I don't care, but it is on my mind more often whether I want it to be or not because I'm just at that age where all my friends are getting married and having kids so the question is always asked about children and when I'm going to start.","score":26,"num_comments":44,"likely_black_context":true,"matched_preg_terms":["fertility","pregnancy","pregnant"],"matched_black_terms":[]}

But I was  thinking about how much I love nutrition. I loved the class, and I still have a good interest in it now. When I became pregnant with my daughter I was I looking at different cultures and how they do the postpartum period. Like the postpartum hotels in Asian countries and people who hire a woman to come to their home and help for a month with breastfeeding, and cooking nutritious food, and the mom's care. I also looked into African customs on this but I felt I couldn't find a lot. There is also the new, one and only boram care in NY that is a postpartum hotel. \n\nI have also have a big interest in pregnancy and birth. Even before I was in a relationship, even when I was a teenager it interested me and I loved learning about how a woman's body works. Since I've gave birth in a hospital being induced and in a birthing center with a spontaneous labor my interest in other women's care has grown even more. I know how for black women pregnancy and birth can be scary because of bad medical professionals not caring about us. I feel it's good to have a strong community to protect ourselves. \n\nNow that I've gone through all that background history, I had an idea to start this business that is geared towards pregnancy/postpartum nutritional health and offers birth doula's and other postpartum care. It can have a kitchen there to make meals for families after having a baby, have birthing classes, night doula's for when parents need some rest,\nAnd breastfeeding support. I am already looking into doing more schooling for nutrition and I have looked into doula training already.  \n\nI just want to know what other black women would think of this. Or am I crazy?

And they did not care until my White husband made them do their job. \n\nI‚Äôm so upset, but not surprised, that this is how I was treated. I carefully selected my medical team for this reason but insurance would not approve ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù postpartum care or imaging referrals from my midwife so I had to switch providers. I‚Äôm looking at months long wait lists for the type of PT I need, possible surgery, and my job is at risk as I‚Äôm temporarily disabled but no longer a protected employee - all *while* still being in debilitating pain and keeping my child alive. I fear I have a long road ahead of fighting to get the care I deserve.\n\nYa‚Äôll get it.

I got dressed for school but I knew my gut was telling me that I should stay home and see a clinic. (I've been absent for 2 days last week because of it)\nThe symptoms would come and go which bothered me and made my anxiety worse. \n\n\nI made up my decision to just return to school tomorrow and to tell my Dad about the recurring symptoms. He called my Mom and that's when my soul dropped.\n\n\nShe looked very aggravated as always, she hated the thought of me not going to school, and being sick was usually not an option for me to stick around at home. (Only when I'm experiencing pretty nerve racking gastrointestinal issues)\n\n\n\nBefore I could even say a word- she throws in a lot of hurtful things.\nShe starts shaming me on missing school for almost 4 days, and that I should immediately go to urgent care to get a PREGNANCY TEST and starts spewing that I'm probably doing sexual intercourse with guys at my school, and that I apparently keep it a secret and don't wanna tell her.\n\n\n\nI keep on reassuring her that I never had sex, nor even been in a relationship- but she ignores me while my Dad has already scheduled an appointment for an actual urinary test for pregnancy. Her special saying is \"Well you never know, you can always be lying and being dirty\"\n\n\n\nThe whole process was just painful, I ended up going to the urgent care full of a bunch of stares and looks, my results came back negative and the doctors and nurses were surprised that I was so young while doing something like this.\n\n\nI felt ashamed of myself for simply being there, I don't know if I suffer a food intolerance or IBS- because i've been eating less but nothing seems to change. The next available appointment for actual lab work and blood tests with a pediatrician would be in January ): so I'm stuck going to school and suffering until then.\n\n\nI just wish that I had the luxury of being loved and cared for by a black mom, I envy those who have caring moms that they can hang out with or spend quality, beautiful time.\n\n\n\nIt hurts everyday being neglected like this, my Dad is 58 but still working hard, and I have 4 other younger siblings (youngest is 6M infant) that he usually takes care of most of time.\n\n\n\nI use the opportunities I have in education to seek a career and a happier life, but I'm just in a very dark and painful situation, I have one great friend that helps me through times like this.

I just found out my husband is cheating on me again. It‚Äôs not the first time, not the second, or even the third. After our last separation, he found a way to slither back into my life. I honestly thought we were doing well for a long time, and then, on our anniversary, a woman called to wish him a \"happy anniversary\" and ask when he would be done so he could come over. üòµ‚Äçüí´\nAnd It was a really good anniversary too, we were having a wonderful time üò™. Any way since that moment a few months ago. It has been a world wind of discovery. Like something supernatural. Every other week something new back to back. Like if it was spread over years the blows would be better but its a few months. \n\nThis time,  I've discovered that many of the women he's involved with are fully aware of me and his family obligations. So he is upfront with them and he has been able to hide so well.  One of them has been in his life for at least 10 years; I was told she was gone, but he simply saved her under a man‚Äôs name in his phone. He also has weird a sexual relationship with two women. Doing things that I didn‚Äôt even know existed in our city.  And these two women are moms so I am shocked that they have the time for these events üòÆ Another is a prominent woman in our city with money who is willing to wait for him to leave me so they can get married. He told me he's keeping her around because of her money.She's the kind of person that if he wasnt my husband and just a friend I would say good catch go get her.  I am honestly shocked that he pulled that person but we never know how people really are behind the public eye. And these are just the main four, there are so many other women he texts, calls, and DMs.\n\nWe recently bought a rental property. So he has the ability to leave. He said he would, but now he refuses to go because he doesn‚Äôt want a custody agreement. He also says its not fully furnished so he cant bring the kids. He wants to see our seven kids, who range from toddlers to college students, whenever he feels like it.\n\n I carry the entire weight of our household, both financially and emotionally. We've been married for almost 20 years, and I have no friends. I'm not from here, so I don't have any family nearby. His family has been my only source of support. My life has become a routine of going from home to work to the kids' activities.\n\nHe constantly tells me that no one else will want me. He says I‚Äôll just go out and find a worse man who will abuse me and the kids. He promises he'll change, comparing himself to someone on drugs and asking me to give him time and work with him. But I know it's a lie, he always lies. And I feel like I can‚Äôt depend on any of these women to have morals. But as some of them say, I shouldn't be mad at them I should be mad at him. True. \n\nI just want to leave. But is it wrong to just disappear and leave him with the kids? I love my babies more than anything, and they say I‚Äôm the responsible parent, which is true. But I am at my breaking point. I truly feel like there's no way out.\n\nUPDATE:  I didn't end up leaving. I just got a hotel for two nights. Came home to a completely junky house.  But the kids were taken care of. He was definitely scared I wasn't coming back but I can't leave them to gain this type of behavior. In my short time away, I have a lawyer on deck, and I am plotting quietly. \nAlso, just a point of clarification: yes I have 7 kids but the 2 oldest who are in college are my bonus kids. I have been in their lives since they were toddlers. So they are around me like they are mine. I have 5 biological kids with 2 of them being twins. So I have technically only been pregnant 4 times.
